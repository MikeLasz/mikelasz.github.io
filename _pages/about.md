Doctoral student working in the Machine Learning group at RUB. My research revolves around deep generative models, such as generative adversarial networks, normalizing flows, diffusion models, and more. I seek to understand those models, uncover their weaknesses, and implement practical improvements, which broaden their fields of application. 

In my spare time, I like to work on fun programming projects and improve my skills for my other passion: playing Lacrosse!
