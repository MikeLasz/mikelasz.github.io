I am thrilled to announce that I have successfully defended my PhD Thesis, titled *Exploring Different Biases in Generative Models*, with the highest distinction---*summa cum laude*.
In this work, I demonstrate how my previous papers align with the general notion of bias in generative models. While my research on *Benchmarking the Fairness of Image Upsampling Methods* addresses the *dataset bias*, works such as *Marginal Tail-Adaptive Normalizing Flows* aim at specifying an *inductive bias*. Lastly, I introduce the novel concept of *generator bias*, which is used to perform model-attribution as shown in my recent ICML publication *Single-Model Attribution of Generative Models Through Final-Layer Inversion*.

You can check out all the details in my thesis, which will be made public soon.
