Exciting news! Our paper, "Single-Model Attribution of Generative Models Through Final-Layer Inversion", got accepted at ICML 2024 in Vienna! 

In this work, we address model attribution of generative models by leveraging modern anomaly detection techniques. 
To improve the performance further, we combine the latter with features extracted by final-layer inversion.

Please find our preprint on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06210). 

Thanks for the collaboration, Jonas!
