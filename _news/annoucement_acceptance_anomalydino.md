Excited to shat that our paper, "AnomalyDINO: Boosting Patch-based Few-shot Anomaly Detection with DINOv2", got accepted at WACV 2025!ðŸŽ‰
In this work, we show how DINOv2 representations can effectively address the few-shot (and even one-shot) visual anomaly detection task. You can find the full paper [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14529v1) and access the code in our public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dammsi/AnomalyDINO).

Once again, I want to give a huge shouthout to Simon (first author) and our supervisors Johannes and Asja for their incredible collabotation.
