:musical_note: We were staying in Paris to ~~get away from your parents~~ present my work on fairness in deep generative models. :musical_note: <br />

Besides giving a talk about my current project on *Fairness of Image Upsampling Methods*, I was delighted to discuss further ideas about fair generative modeling with [Prof. Mohamed Hebiri and his team](https://perso.math.u-pem.fr/hebiri.mohamed/hebiri-en.html) from the Universit√© Gustave Eiffel. Thanks for having me!
