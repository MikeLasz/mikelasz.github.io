I am happy to share that our paper, "Benchmarking the Fairness of Image Upsampling Methods", has been accepted at ACM FAccT 2024. ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· 

In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework for benchmarking the performance and fairness of conditional generative models. We explore the specific application of image upsampling and create a benchmark covering a wide variety of modern upsampling methods.

Check out our preprint on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13555).

Thanks to my awesome collaborators at ETH Zurich, UHH, and RUB!
